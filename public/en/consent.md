**The goal of this research is** to understand how people read data visualization to form their most intuitive answer to a given question.

You will have to identify a scpecific element or count elements in the chart.The charts will be visible only for a short time, so read it quickly, then type your answer in the provided area right below the chart.

**What you will get:** We hope that you will find the exercise enjoyable. Your participation will help us understand how people quickly read charts to form answer to questions.

**Duration:** about 10 minutes.

**Record keeping:** Records of your participation will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study investigators and, under certain circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to this data.

**Risks:** We do not expect there to be any risks beyond daily use of computer devices.

**Your participation is anonymous** and your responses cannot be used to identify you.
