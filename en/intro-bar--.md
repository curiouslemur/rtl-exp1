# Instructions (part 1)

In this section of the study, consider the following scenario. 

<div class="hover-box">
You are part of a research team at your local Art Museum, tasked with analyzing visitor patterns.
In the following pages, you will be presented with a series of bar charts that show the number of daily visitors over several days.

Your task is to interpret the charts and answer questions to help understand the museum’s daily attendance.

<!-- -------------------------------------------- -->
<div class="highlight-box"><b> About the barchart </b></div>

- Each day is represented by one bar in the barchart.

- The height of a bar represents the recorded number of visitors during that day (the actual value is shown above the bar). A general rule of thumb is that the taller the bar, the more visitors there were on that day.

- The days are ordered from the first to the last day of the study.

- Black-colored bars indicate **holidays**

- Each trial consists of a question and a chart. There are no trick questions.
- Once you show a chart, **it will disappear after a few seconds** so, read it as quickly as possible. 
- You will see different barchart configurations, however, your task remains the same: 
Read the question → show the chart → answer using a dropdown list, or write in a text area.
