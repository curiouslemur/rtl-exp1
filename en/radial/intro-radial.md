<div class="hover-box">

You will see a series fo circular charts showing how the visitors are placed in the room. 
Your task is to interpret the charts and answer questions about the visitors' seating patterns.

<div class="highlight-box"><b> About the table circular chart</b></div>

- Visitors are ushered to their seats in the order they arrived in the room. That is, the first visitor is seated first, the second visitor will sit next to the first, the third visitor will be next to the second, etc... 

- Only occupied seats are shown in the data visualization. They will be arranged in circle around an imaginary table.

- The first arriving visitor will be indicated by an arrow.

- Black-colored circles indicate the visitor is a **special guest**.

- Like in the previous part, each trial consists of a question and a chart. There are no trick questions.
- Once you show a chart, **it will disappear after a few seconds** so, read it as quickly as possible. 
- You will see different settings for the visualization, however, your task remains the same: 
Read the question → show the chart → answer using using the provided space.
